# Root_Finding_Techniques
Utilizing root solving techniques such as:
* Bisection Method
* Fixed-Point Method
* Newton's Method

Demonstrates numerical methods used to find solutions of nonlinear equations. Each script has a nonlinear function and error tolerance built into it, but both can be changed by the user.
