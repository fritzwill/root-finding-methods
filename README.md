# Root_Finding_Techniques
Utilizing root solving techniques such as:
* Bisection Method
* Fixed-Point Method
* Newton's Method

Demonstrates numerical methods used to find solutions of nonlinear equations. Each script has a nonlinear function and error tolerance built into it, but both can be changed by the user. 

## Using the scripts

These three files are all python 2.7 scripts. Each has a shebang (```#!/usr/bin/env python2.7```) which allows them to be run from the command line. However make sure your python version is 2.7.*:
```
$ python --version
Python 2.7.9
```

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
